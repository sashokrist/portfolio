        <p>To achieve anything requires perseverance, hard work and faith that you will succeed That is what I believe
          in. I just graduated as ICT Engineer Bachelor at VIA University Collage, I have experience as office manager
          and web developer, I have been working for the last 10 years in three Danish software companies in Sofia,
          Bulgaria. I’m a team player, goal oriented and well structured. I’m open mind I can see opportunity almost
          everywhere, I love new challenges and I’m a quick learner, I love the difficult tasks and solve them no
          matter how much time and effort I need to use. I love to work under pressure, I’m not afraid of writing code
          and fixing bugs all night. I build trust, that is why people rely on me. I build strong relations and I never
          give up. I love to travel and meet new people. I would very much like to start working in the IT area as
          front-end or back-end developer (PHP, .NET, WordPress, Drupal, HTML/CSS).</p>
